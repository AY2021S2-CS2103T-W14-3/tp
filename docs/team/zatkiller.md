## Project: HEY MATEz

HEY MATEz is a desktop application to get rid of your woes by allowing you to track members and tasks within a club efficiently and easily! 
It is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application which handles user requests that are typed into the input box as commands and 
it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark a task as completed or uncompleted. (Pull Requests: [\#96](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/pull/101), [\#101](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/pull/101))
  
  * What it does: allows the user to change the status of a task from completed or uncompleted.
  
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can indicate whether a task is completed or uncompleted. With this indication, users
  are able to focus on tasks that are not completed yet.  
  
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as I had to design the feature such that it was only restricted to 2 values - completed and uncompleted. After taking into account design 
  considerations, I decided to implement an Enum class named TaskStatus, with UNCOMPLETED and COMPLETED as the enum constants. Using this, I was able to add an additional attribute
  to the Task Class, status, while being able to restrict the allowed values of a task's status to completed and uncompleted. 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to prioritize a task. (Pull Requests: [\#114](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/pull/114))

  * What it does: allows the user to assign a task a certain priority.
  
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can indicate the priority of a task - high, medium, low or unassigned. With this priority value, users
  will be to focus on tasks which are of higher priority.
  
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as I had to design the feature such that it was only restricted to 4 values - high, medium, low and unassigned. After taking into account design 
  considerations, I decided to implement an Enum class named PRIORITY, with HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW and UNASSIGNED as the enum constants. Using this, I was able to add an additional attribute
  to the Task Class, priority, while being able to restrict the allowed values of a task's priority to high, medium, low or unassigned.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find tasks assigned to a particular member. (Pull Requests: [\#168](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/pull/168))
  
  * What it does: allows the user to find all tasks assigned to a particular member.
  
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently search what tasks has been assigned to a particular member.
  
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as I had to think of a way to check which tasks have been assigned to a particular member. After considering the current software architecture,
  I made a decision to implement a predicate, TaskContainsAssigneePredicate. When the Task List is updated with the predicate, the predicate calls the `hasAssignee` method of the Task class to check 
  if the name specified in the command exists as an assignee and updates the Task List accordingly.
