## Project: HEY MATEz

HEY MATEz is a desktop application to get rid of your woes by allowing you to track members and tasks within 
the club efficiently and easily! It is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application which handles user requests 
that are typed into the input box as commands and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
