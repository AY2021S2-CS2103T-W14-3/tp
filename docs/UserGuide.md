## Introduction
HEY MATEz is a desktop application to get rid of CCA leaders' woes by allowing them to track 
members and tasks within the CCA efficiently. It is
a Command Line Interface (CLI) application while still retaining a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
as this application is catered to students who are used to typing on the keyboard frequently.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addTask -n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addTask -n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `-d DESCRIPTION [-p PRIORITY]` can be used as `-d Meeting -p high` or as `-d Meeting`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -p PHONE_NUMBER`, `-p PHONE_NUMBER -n NAME` is also acceptable.
  
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `-p 12341234 -p 56785678`, only `-p 56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
