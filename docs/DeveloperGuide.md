## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
This section documents some of the noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented

### Mark as completed / uncompleted features

The implementation of the mark as completed and uncompleted features are facilitated by the `DoneTaskCommand` and `
UndoTaskCommand` classes respectively, both of which extends from the Command abstract class.

It is also facilitated by the following Parser Classes:
* `DoneTaskCommandParser`
* `UndoTaskCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser classes all inherit the `#parse` method from the Parser interface.

* `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current DoneCommand is valid and creates an DoneTaskCommand instance if it is.

* `UndoTaskCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current Undo Command is valid and creates an UndoTaskCommand instance if it is.

Subsequently, the created `DoneTaskCommand` / `UndoTaskCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which is responsible for
updating the status of the Task to "completed" or "uncompleted". This is achieved by creating a new `Task` object with the
same fields and values but updating the `TaskStatus` field according to the input.

Below is the usage scenario and how the mark the completed mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has an existing task

Step 1. User executes the `done 1` command to mark the 1st task in the task list of HEY MATEz to be completed.  A
`DoneTaskCommandParser` is created and it calls the `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` on the arguments

Step 2. `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` method will check on the validity of the arguments for a `DoneTaskCommand`. If it
is valid,  it will call the create a new `DoneTaskCommand` by calling the constructor.

Step 4. The `DoneTaskCommand#execute` is then called by the `LogicManger`. The task with the same `Index` is retrieved and
a copy of the task is created with the same attribute values. However. the `TaskStatus` value is updated to be 'completed'
in the `Model`.

Step 5. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_DONE_TASK_SUCCESS` is used to return a new Command Result
with the attached message.

Below is the sequence diagram:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* CCA / Club head who is managing many members
* Needs an efficient and organised method to assign tasks to these members.
* Need to manage a significant number of members
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing to mouse interactions

**Value proposition**: Manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app


### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Priority | As a …​                                    | I want to …​                     | So that I can…​                                                        |

| `* * `  | CCA leader | change the assignee of a task | easily update the member assigned to the task |
| `* * `  | CCA leader | assign a priority to a task | see which tasks need to be completed first |
| `* * `  | CCA leader who has many tasks to supervise | search for tasks which are of a certain priority | better manage tasks of different priorities |
| `* * `  | CCA leader whose members have different roles | assign roles to the members in the application | now who has a certain role |
| `* * `  | CCA leader whose members have different roles | edit the roles to the members in the application  | update the member roles when there is a change in roles |
| `* `  | CCA leader who is very forgetful | be notified if I have accidentally added duplicate items/tasks | I will not add repeated tasks. |
| `* `  | CCA leader who has a lot of tasks to delegate | search for tasks which contain a particular word  | find tasks more efficiently |
| `* `  | forgetful CCA leader who has forgotten which tasks have not been assigned | be able to get a list of tasks that have not been assigned | distribute tasks more efficiently |
