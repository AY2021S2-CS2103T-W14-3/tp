## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/heymatez/Main.java) 
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/heymatez/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteTask 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/heymatez/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/heymatez/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/heymatez/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `HeyMatezParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteTask 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteTask 1` Command](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/heymatez/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the heymatez data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/heymatez/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Hey Matez data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.heymatez.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
This section documents some of the noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented

### Mark as completed / uncompleted features

The implementation of the mark as completed and uncompleted features are facilitated by the `DoneTaskCommand` and `UndoTaskCommand` classes respectively, both of which extends from the Command abstract class.

The execution of the command is also facilitated by the following Parser Classes:
* `DoneTaskCommandParser`
* `UndoTaskCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser classes inherit the `#parse` method from the `Parser` interface.

* `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current DoneTaskCommand is valid and creates an DoneTaskCommand instance if it is.
* `UndoTaskCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current UndoTaskCommand is valid and creates an UndoTaskCommand instance if it is.

Subsequently, the created `DoneTaskCommand` / `UndoTaskCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which is responsible for
updating the status of the Task to `completed` or `uncompleted`. This is achieved by creating a new `Task` object with the
same fields and values but updating the `TaskStatus` field depending on which command is being executed.

<br/>
Below is the usage scenario and how the mark task as completed mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has an existing task whose status is `uncompleted`

Step 1. User executes the `done 1` command to mark the task with index number 1 in the task list of HEY MATEz as `completed`. 
 A `DoneTaskCommandParser` object is created and it calls `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` on the arguments given.

Step 2. The `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse` method will check the validity of the argument given for a `DoneTaskCommand`. If it
is valid, it will create a new `DoneTaskCommand` instance by calling the constructor of `DoneTaskCommand`.

Step 3. The `DoneTaskCommand#execute` method is then called by the `LogicManager`. The task with the same `Index` is retrieved and
a copy of the task is created with the same attribute values. However, the `TaskStatus` value is updated to `completed`. The task copy
with the updated status replaces the old task in the `Model`.

Step 4. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_DONE_TASK_SUCCESS` is used to return a new Command Result
with the attached message.

Below is the sequence diagram to show how the mark task as completed mechanism works:

![#Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `done 1` Command](images/DoneTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

### Find Tasks with deadline before a selected date feature

The implementation of the finding of tasks with deadlines before a selected date is facilitated by the `FindTasksBeforeCommand`
class, which extends from the Command abstract class.

It is also facilitated by the following Parser Class:
* `FindTasksBeforeCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser class inherits the `#parse` method from the Parser interface.

* `FindTasksBeforeParser#parse` - checks if the deadline passed to the current FindTasksBeforeCommand is in the correct format and is valid, then creates a FindTasksBeforeCommand instance if they are.


Subsequently, the created `FindTasksBeforeCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which is responsible for
updating the task list to contain the tasks with deadlines before the selected date. This is achieved by calling on `Model#updateFilteredTaskList`
with the DeadlineBeforeDatePredicate which updates the task list with tasks that match the given predicate.

Below is the usage scenario and how the finding of tasks due before a selected date mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has existing tasks with their corresponding deadlines

Step 1. User executes the `findBefore 2021-04-04` command to show the tasks in the task list of HEY MATEz with deadlines before 2021-04-04.  A
`FindTasksBeforeCommandParser` is created and it calls `FindTasksBeforeParser#parse` on the arguments

Step 2. The `FindTasksBeforeCommandParser#parse` method will check the validity of the deadline argument for a `FindTasksBeforeCommand`. If it is
valid,  it will create a new `FindTasksBeforeCommand` instance by calling the constructor with the DeadlineBeforeDatePredicate.

Step 3. The `FindTasksBeforeCommand#execute` method is then called by the `LogicManager`. The tasks with deadline before 2021-04-04 are selected by the 
DeadlineBeforeDatePredicate.

Step 4. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_TASKS_LISTED_OVERVIEW,` is used to return a new Command Result
with the attached message.

Below is the sequence diagram:

![#Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `findBefore 2021-04-04` Command](images/FindBeforeSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete a Task feature

The implementation of the delete a task feature is facilitated by the DeleteTaskCommand, which extends from the Command abstract class.

It is also enabled by the following Parser class:
* `DeleteTaskCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser class inherits the `#parse method` from the Parser interface.

* `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current DeleteTaskCommand is valid. 
  If the arguments are valid, it creates a DeleteTaskCommand instance.

Subsequently, the created `DeleteTaskCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which 
is responsible for deleting the given Task with respect to the index. This is achieved by calling on
`Model#deleteTask` with the task to be deleted where it will be removed from the list of tasks. 

Below is the usage scenario of how delete task mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has an existing task

Step 1. User executes the `deleteTask 1` command to delete the task at the 1st index in the task list of HEY MATEz. 
A `DeleteTaskCommandParser` object is created and calls the `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parse` on the arguments.

Step 2. The `DeleteTaskCommandParser#parse` method then checks on the validity of the arguments given for a `DeleteTaskCommand`. 
If it is valid, it will create a new `DeleteTaskCommand` instance by calling the constructor along with the task `Index`.

Step 3. The `DeleteTaskCommand#execute` method is then called by `Logic Manager`. The task with the same `Index` is retrieved
and deleted from the task list when `Model#deleteTask` is called.

Step 4. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_DELETE_TASK_SUCCESS` is used to return a 
new Command Result with the attached message.

Below is the sequence diagram: 

![#Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteTask 1` Command](images/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram below summarizes what happens when a user executes the delete task command:

![#Activity Diagram for Delete Task](images/DeleteTaskActivityDiagram.png)

### Clear all Assignees of a Task feature

The implementation of the clear all assignees of a task feature is facilitated by the `ClearAssigneeCommand` 
class which extends from the Command abstract class.

It is also facilitated by the following Parser Classes:
* `ClearAssigneesCommandParser`

The above mentioned Parser class inherits the `#parse` method from the Parser interface.

* `ClearAssigneesCommandParser#parse` - checks if the arguments passed to the current ClearAssigneeCommand is valid. 
  If the arguments are valid, it creates a ClearAssigneeCommand instance.

Subsequently, the created `ClearAssigneeCommand` object contains an `#execute` method which is responsible for
clearing all assignees of the Task, with respect to its index. This is achieved by creating a new 
`Task` object with the same fields and values as before but with the assignees field set to be a new empty HashSet. 

Below is the usage scenario of how the clear all assignees of a Task mechanism behaves.

Assumptions:
1. User has already launched the app
2. HEY MATEz application has an existing task with **assignees**

Step 1. User executes the `clearAssignees 1` command to clear all the assignees of the task at index 1 in the task list of 
HEY MATEz. A ` ClearAssigneesCommandParser` object is created and it calls `ClearAssigneesCommandParser#parse` on the arguments.

Step 2. The `ClearAssigneesCommandParser#parse` method will check on the validity of the arguments given for a `ClearAssigneesCommand`. 
If it is valid, it will create a new `ClearAssigneesCommand` instance by calling the constructor of `ClearAssigneesCommand`.

Step 3. The `ClearAssigneesCommand#execute` method is then called by the `LogicManager`. The task with the same `Index` 
is retrieved and a copy of the task is created with the same attribute values but with the assignees field updated to be a 
new empty HashSet. The copy of the task with the updated assignees field replaces the old task in the `Model`.

Step 4. Once the execution is completed, the message `MESSAGE_CLEARED_ASSIGNEES_SUCCESS` is used to return a new Command Result
with the attached message.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear all assignees of a Task mechanism behaves. 

![#Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `clearAssignees 1` Command](images/ClearAssigneeSequenceDiagram.png)

* Note: The lifeline for `ClearAssigneesCommandParser` and `ClearAssigneesCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) 
  but due to the limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the sequence diagram.
